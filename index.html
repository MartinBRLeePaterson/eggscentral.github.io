    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">Like the Pentagon, but better. This is where the main offices of EGGS are. In an undisclosed location, the most senior members of EGGS hierarchy file paperwork, coordinate missions, relay communications, think up mind-bending plans, etc. Director Robert Michaels, Vice Director Lily Warden and the five heads of departments all rub elbows here. The walls lean outwards, making it just that tiny bit harder for TASTY agents to scale, if they ever find the building in the first place. </p>

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">A hangout for the admininstration staff. Much more formal than The Grid. The Great Paperwork Competition was held here, and many interns start out here (lessening the workload on the Admin staff). Don't mention the Invite Incident to anybody over twenty years old if you value your life. The Admin Admins will give you literal hell if you do!</p>

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">
    The media room's a holodeck, so it takes the form of its user's dream media surveying room. That's why it isn't very professional. There are anime posters stuck thickly, covering the walls like several layers of wallpaper.  The only part of the wall not covered in posters are the massive television screens, with which XnDRIIA monitors all major news networks. Around them are computers and radios, to monitor radio news, intercept evil plans and play Tetris. And watch anime of course. Always anime. And maybe a few cat videos. A few. Not many, a few. Looking out of place are bookshelves full of books and filing cabinets, in the event of a power failure. And the agents may or may not enjoy the smell of books.</p>

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;">This is one of the most highly secured places in the Headquarters. It has all the security measures you would expect from a spy organization, and then some. With it's back to the door, a cozy white desk, and a fake-leather swivelly chair stands behind it. It's high black neck rest seems to preside over the rest of the room, and if you lean in and take a deep breath you can catch a whiff of hair gel. No matter it's unassuming appearance, if need be it can travel up to 80 kph, powered by a small engine the Science division devised. Fantastic way to win office chair races! Behind it, a one-way glass forms the western wall, offering a breath-taking view of the sunset. </p>

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">Where injured agents come to heal. The "lair" is actually the entire Block C, boasting five floors, one for the operating theatres, two for wards, one for offices and another for physical therapy. Each ward is named for a different famous nurse, making it a bit confusing for people who don't know their history to navigate-they're in chronological order. Behind the reception desk is a framed portrait of Florence Nightingale, watching over all who enter. Agent Luke Cone holds the record for the most visits to date, with 394 trips in the bag. </p>

The floor is astroturf, lined with ruts from the weight of a wheelchair. A mahogany desk ornamented with coffee mug stains, minus a chair poises on a heavy woven carpet, with an alarm button concealed on the underside. Her window wall, unlike the Director's, faces east. As opposite as people can be, they are each other's yin and yang. Many junior agents have placed bets on when they will get together. She likes to wake early and sleep early, while he is not a morning person and does paperwork until late at night, like their office windows. </p>

A gleaming wall with engraved bronze plaques, bearing the names who have fallen in combat. The very first one is ANTHEA NICOLE COULTAIN-ROGERS 1955. Among them are JAGER DOVE 1980, MARIAN MAYHAND 1991, and DART FOSTER 2013. Every year on November 11, agents everywhere stop and take a minute to remember those who sacrificed their lives for EGGS.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family:Bungee;">The Academy</h1>
    <p>It's like a school. EGGS have different specialized branches: Administration, Communications, Field, Science, and Life Preservers. Admin is where you go to learn how to file paperwork. Communications is keeping in touch with any agents or bases. Field go undercover to work assignments. They're the brawn and Science is the brain. Life Preservers are the normal people that aren't especially brilliant at anything-they don't get obsessed or irritatingly self-sacrificing.  They learn how to care for stubborn field agents, scientists wrapped up in their work, and workaholics with lots of work to do. <br><br>Administration looks just like an office. White, gleaming and ship shape. Their trainees have a dress code of neat unexposing pressed shirts, ties, and skirts, dresses or long trousers. No dyed hair and if it's long, it has to be tied back. Facial hair, except for fancy mustaches is not allowed. Their dormitories are spotless, two to a room. Their bathrooms are the neatest in the entire world, and would be in the Guinness World Records if keeping records of this place was allowed.<br><br>Communications is very techy. Monitors are everywhere, like spiders. They tend to be loud, organized and extroverted. They are very confident and efficient. There is no dress code. Their dormitories are average, four to a room.<br><br>Field is very military-like. Just better. They are given army uniform to wear, and most prefer to wear sports clothing in their free time. All the males have crew cuts and females have a maximum of shoulder length hair, to be tied up at all times. They barely have any indoor classrooms as they prefer to be based in the wild, and take advantage of nature's gifts. The trainees sleep in shelters they make on the first day.<br><br>Science is basically a complex of science labs and dormitories. You have to be on guard at all times as experiments go wrong quite easily and the pranks pulled here are stupendous. The most famous of them was when a student called <span class="redacted">Plesiosaur</span> transformed Principal <span class="redacted">Thropp</span>'s skin bright green. She ended up having to get multiple skin grafts to remove it. Mentioning it in front of Principal <span class="redacted">Thropp</span> will get you an immediate week of detentions and Antigravity Testing Duty. The dormitories are usually full of spare parts and inventions. They mostly walk around wearing lab coats, overalls, jumpsuits or dungarees. Their hair is messy and more often than not they have goggles pushed up on their heads or rubber gloves on their hands.<br><br>Life Preservers don't have an academy, just a three-week course in How To Handle Your Specialist. If they are successful, their babysittee, sorry, specialist, will form a bond with them that will last until the end of their EGGS career and beyond.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family:Bungee;">Ground Zero</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px;"> In Laboratory Block A, the office of Plesiosaur is a strange place. Laboratory Block B is undergoing renovation after something very classified. Old unfinished automatons, gadgets, and machines make the room cluttered, cramped and dangerous to those unused to navigating the it, a strange cross between a jungle and a scrap heap. There are rumors that there are mechanical snakes in the particularly dark corners. Plesiosaur does nothing about the rumors. He likes the privacy. In fact, he likes the privacy so much, there are no less than five passcodes, keys, retinal and fingerprint scans before you encounter the office door. The office door is blue, with a sign on top that says 'Police Public Call Box' , and he uses various Doctor Who style screwdrivers instead of your standard tool kit.<br>Adjoined to the office is a cozy bedroom, quite unlike what you would expect from an Atlantean agent whose idea of fun is either coding or blowing up gummy bears. Preferably red ones. Unusually, the door is a rocket-like vault door. Clear blue water fills the room, allowing Atlantean gills to relax. The water is continually filtered. A hovering blue bed lies in the middle with rotating holograms surrounding it of Atlantean script. Model trains travel around the walls, and the room is lit by above-averagely sized glowsticks.

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">     The gym is naturally the room with the most vents. There are bullseyes, quintains, sparring dummies, a boxing ring, crash dummies, an obstacle course, weights, a treadmill and a bike machine. In addition, there's a multi-purpose court for team bonding activities. Possibly the oddest objects inside are drones armed with paintball guns designed to be moving target practice. With them, an imagined easy exercise could become a case of the hunters becoming the hunted. Obviously, a first aid kit is within easy reach. After all, they don't become the best team in the world without a few mishaps. Weapons racks hold lethal artillery. Leading off to the north are the changing rooms, each filled with state-of-the-arts showers, baths, sinks, toilets and a rare indulgence, a massage chair. Fluffy towels drape over the towel racks, so white it hurts to look at them for more than a minute. Not that any of the agents ever need such extravagant cleansers, as they don't sweat, they glisten.
    <br>Hell also houses an Olympic-sized swimming pool. And not in the modern sporting sense of the word, in the Ancient Greek sense. Plesiosaur being Atlantean, he uses it the most and there is a replica of an Atlantean shallow waters navigational craft. The pool can be used for regular swimming and also scuba diving, but at one of the crazier EGGS parties it has also been used as a giant tub of lime flavoured jelly. At its deepest point, it measures at a kilometer deep. Nearly touching the ceiling is a tall diving board and the mouth of an enormous water slide, coiling around the interior of the room so participants gather maximum velocity before making a big splash.

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">To find the lair of Cetuberstego, all you have to do is follow your nose. The salty scent of potatoes simmering, boiling, being mashed, fried and generally cooked is a dead giveaway to where the Potato Master abides, the kitchen. A Round Table stands in the middle of the dining room, with plants named Arthur, Merlin and Gwen. Equality for all, right?<br>Strangely, a lance is in here too. It really belongs in Hell, but nobody is bothered to return it, after an incident never to be mentioned again involving an indoor barbecue, a very very fresh meal and some pink glitter. They affectionately call it Lancelot. It, or rather he, has a friend called Excalibur, brought in when they ran out of knives (long story. Two words: Target Practice) and somebody couldn't be bothered to use a spork. <br>As a joke, XnDRIIA hacked the window programming and turned the night sky green. XnDRIIA refuses to change them back and nobody else knows how, so everybody just calls the windows the Green Knight.<br>A storeroom at the back with sixteen steps contains a seemingly endless supply of food. Baked beans, borscht, ketchup, corn sauce, pasta bags, energy bars, cup noodle, dried mango, tinned peaches, Ovaltine, tea bags and coffee, flour, space ice cream, chocolate, Oreo, cat food, you name it.

    <h1 style="position:relative;font-family:Bungee;">Dungeon</h1>
    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">Of course, in every organization there exists a place to retain baddies. Unlike it's medieval counterpart, this one does not have a torture chamber. After all, they are humane. The alternative is a solitary confinement chamber. Deprived of all their senses, in pitch black darkness floating in water all alone can convince someone to spill the beans quite quickly.  For this purpose, there is an interrogation room. Stripped bare of everything but a table and chair bolted to the floor, one-way glass windows, drains in the floor and a pair of minimalist handcuffs, it's very difficult to escape or commit suicide. These are Mike Oxlong's quarters, until she proves herself worthy.

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">Plesiosaur had a Star-Trek style Holodeck installed. He explicitly stated that it was for strategy and planning, not gaming. The team immediately decided to disobey his explicit instructions, and installed fifty games plus Skype on the first day. Hatch is the current Flappy Bird champion, much to the chagrin of her colleagues. It's even better than the original, as it's 3D. Poor Plesiosaur doesn't really get humans...

<h1 style="position:relative;font-family:Bungee;">Dimension 221</h1>
    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">What secret base would be complete without an entertainment room? An interactive board takes up one wall, facing plush armchairs and beanbags. Gaming consoles attract your attention next to it, and for the more traditional approach, an entire library fills your vision opposite to the cinema. In the middle, a disco floor complete with disco ball flashes and sparkles. It was only recently installed after much pleading and persuasion from Hatch to Diceratops. Tucked away in the corner are a couple of vintage pinball and Pacman machines.

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">All the animals in EGGS live here in their own seperate keneels. There are never ever ever ever any fights (XNDRIIA claims) and Balto the Dog would never hurt a fly (Plesiosaur claims). We're <em>totally</em> sure they're telling the truth. Residents include Agents Balto, Gatsby, Gordo, Simba, and the three Turtle Cams. Balto even gets his own Doghouse for when the cats are getting on his circuits.     It's not a house, per se. More like a room adjacent to Ground Zero. As the name suggests, it belongs to a dog, not just any dog, but the one and only Balto. The ceiling is incredibly low. It's a bit of a stretch to build high ceilings when <br><br>a) you're underground<br>b) you're less than a metre tall.<br><br>A baby blue, well-worn dog bed lies in the corner, with Balto's beloved blanket,along with an indoor forest. Everybody, dogs included, has to do their business. The cavern needs no security measures as nobody else can fit through the tunnel leading to it, unless they take a drill and blaze into it.

    <h1 style="position:relative;top:30px;font-family:Bungee;">The Chamber Of Reflection</h1>
    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">    The chamber of reflection is accessible only through a mirror maze which may or may not involve hallucinogens (no negative side-effects) which are ingested by drinking tea, and invisible doors. Only when you get there do you realize that the maze is a single long corridor, which rearranges itself to give the impression of a maze. In the chamber, there's a massive mirror, with curtains for those who got lost in the maze. If you'd spent hours navigating a mirrored maze, you'd be sick of your own face too. If you're lucky, the mysterious head of field, Hatch, may be putting on a live performance. It's not just that she loves theatre, it just never hurts to get into character when your life is a lie, and so is your job. Rumor has it she managed to navigate the maze in just over three minutes, which is exemplary when everybody else takes an average of three hours. Hey, brilliant way to kill time!<br><br>In the middle is a peaceful glade with twelve bonsai trees and twelve cherry blossom trees. Tai Chi and meditation mats are set up here. In spring, it is a truly breathtaking sight, pink petals dancing in the air. To put it poetically, "They caress your face." And before you ask how they survive when they're underground and receive no rain or sunlight, don't.

    <h1 style="position:relative;top:30px;font-family:Bungee;">Farm</h1>
    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">Being a self-sufficient base, it naturally has a farm. Most of the area has been conquered by potatoes, courtesy of Cetuberstego, and rice, being staple foods. Hatch's personal favourite crop is chili peppers, and Plesiosaur prefers a native fruit called eaushuiagua. XnDRIIA doesn't really care, but likes decorating the plant pots with confused faces, and Diceratops likes peaches. Apples are also a favorite, and the trees grow in a copse in the middle, ringed by banana trees, which incidentally are not trees but herbs. Fields of wheat sway in the artificial breeze under the superficial blue sky. Tomato stalks and grape vines crawl up the walls while carrots mature underfoot. On the western side, a classic windmill slowly turns, it's sole purpose to grind wheat to make flour. When October rolls around, pumpkins replace a potato patch and each member carves their own jack o'lantern. Christmas heralds the growth of a fir tree, which is decorated with various interesting memorabilia.

    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">    Obviously, it generates electricity. It's not the sole electricity source- treadmills in Hell are linked up to turbines and there's a backup one in the conference room, along with cupboards of batteries and hand-cranks. It's quite noisy so the room is soundproofed, and as a safety precaution anyone who enters has to wear earmuffs. No-one likes the pick fluffy ones. Strangely, Plesiosaur enjoys coming here to think as the sound of gears turning reminds him of the sound of his mind working.

    <h1 style="position:relative;top:30px;font-family:Bungee;">The Black Hole</h1>
    <p style="position:relative;font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;">    Deep underground, only accessible by an unsuspecting manhole (well, it's only supposed to be accessible by that manhole. In reality, there are multiple secret exits.) is Diceratops' den. Posters of codes cover the walls where bookshelves aren't. They might, just might, have levers opening up hidden chambers beyond. Messy stacks of diagrams pile up on a desk with the word "BORED" carved into it multiple times. Lying around are tools, markers and just about every art implement on the planet, and some not. Walking barefoot around here is a big no-no, as stepping on something could hurt more than a piece of Lego.

    Contrasting with the violent appearance of the rest of the room are dozens of stuffed toy cows on a bunk bed in the corner, with a sign saying: "HERE LIE SLEEPING DRAGONS". Grey sheets hang off the top to give the impression that a cave is actually there, coupled with dinosaur models standing around. A door leading to a bathroom is there too, but you don't really need to know that, do you?

    <h1 style="position:relative;top:20px;margin: 0;padding: 21px 0;">HISTORIES</h1>
    <p style="margin: 0;padding: 21px 0;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;font-size:25px;">It all started on April 15th, 1955 when Nikola MacCartson, a young reporter, went to review a restaurant called McDonalds'. Digging deep beneath the surface, she uncovered horrifying tales of animals being experimented on and genetically modified
      in a quest to create the tastiest meat, mass bred, treated like unfeeling objects and other terrible facts. She discovered they were affiliated with KFC, then already a flourishing food chain, and Burger King, a new up-and-rising commerce. Their
      alliance was christened "TASTY". MacCartson prepared a powerful article, but the newspaper she worked for rejected it, saying it was "too disturbing for public eyes". Unable to just stand by and watch, she decided to do something, creating the birth
      of EGGS.<br><br>Knowing she could never combat such popular companies openly, she searched for like-minded people, first meeting up in in-the-wall restaurants, then in each other's houses and by 1960 when there were enough members, office rooms.
      They lived double lives, normal working class citizens by day, fast-food rebels by night. They would sneak into enemy offices and document incriminating paperwork, releasing it to the public in attempts to warn them. They protested, boycotted, put
      posters up,and handed out leaflets. The public listened for a while, however there were always people who went back to eat more. <br><br>By 1963, MacCartson realized that to defeat TASTY, they needed trained recruits. So she started up the Academy.
      Divided into five divisions (Administration, Communications, Field, Science and Life-savers), trainees studied the area they had the most aptitude for, at first undergoing two years of training and when new information was released and EGGS received
      more funding, the training period was extended to four years. Oregano Caning became Head of Administration, Jack Tripousa became Head of Communications, <span class="redacted">Jager Dove became the Head of Field, Fritz Simon became the Head of Science and Douglas Doolie became Head of Life-savers. <br><br>The Battle of Beruloo took place in 1965. EGGS had just discovered a massive experimentation site and agents were flocking into the final showdown. Tension was in the air and spirits were high. TASTY agents were in the lab and they were facing off. </span><br><br>1963
      was also the year Agent Marian Mayhand graduated at the top of her class. A specialist, she became a legend, nicknamed the Infantry for her outstanding missions. Her field career was glowing and looking to become even brighter, until the tragedy
      of 1977.<br><br>Mayhand had been sent to take out a head of the TASTY animal experimentation called Arnold Z. Everything looked to be as expected until she arrived at the subject containment chambers, where the target was currently dissecting a
      live cow. Other cattle were being forced to watch this. Unknowingly, they had ruined the mission. Mayhand was behind her target, ready for a head shot, but the cattle saw her and mooed. He turned around and hit a red button, releasing a gas that
      made the bovines extremely angry and unlocking the cage doors. They all charged at her, but in accordance with EGGS beliefs she did not harm a single cow, instead interrogating Arnold Z. for the antidote, all the while dodging infuriated cows. She
      did not entirely succeed, and they were both very badly injured. Arnold Z. died before he gave the answer up, but the cattle calmed down after a few hours as the drug wore off. Mayhand sustained multiple injuries, putting her out of fieldwork forever.
      <br><br>Never one to give up, Mayhand went back to the Academy again as soon as she recovered to work in Communications, once more graduating at the top of her class. She quickly rose up the ranks, eventually directing the most complex operations,
      and working with some of the most influential people in EGGS' history, including Director Nikola MacCartson. In 1984, she was made Vice Director. <br><br>The year was 1971 and Oregano Caning had decided to retire. The problem was, he hadn't selected
      his replacement yet and there were no obvious candidates. So, he thought up the Paperwork Competition of 1971. More paperwork than Administration could handle was coming in and they were at their wit's end. Agents were still filing mission reports
      from months ago, and they needed to deal with it fast. Candidates were to fill out as much paperwork as possible in a period of 24 hours, and the person to do it with the most quality would get the job. Ten candidates were shortlisted, and with
      much coffee and tea, Agent Shan Shou-Wen won. A few years later, in 1980, Jager Dove was fatally injured on a mission and died in a coma three days later. Quickly, Sanjay Adrian stepped in to take his place. <br><br>When MacCartson retired in June
      1990, the position of Director was taken over by Marian Mayhand, her Vice Director Blake Jesper. Jack Tripousa retired the same year, as did Shan Shou-Wen. They were replaced by Wilhelmina Watson and Gregory Hooter. Mayhand formed the Dorg Alliance
      and set up the departments of BELL, HEN, and CHICK. After analyzing the lastest fast food consumer statistics, she concluded that fast food chains were targeting children, as they were the new generation that grew up with fast food as something
      that had always been there and were too innocent to know the dangers of fast food. So she started to recruit children, in order to more efficiently battle TASTY. Sadly, her brilliant life was cut short as she was assassinated by a TASTY agent while
      delivering a speech. Her time as Director lasted just under a year.<br><br>Blake Jesper took over as archdirector with <span class="redacted">Robert "Bobby" Michaels</span> as his vice. Neither a field agent or a reporter, Jesper was an amazing
      strategist and solved problems with an ease that unnerved many people. At the time of MacCartson's death in 1997, her legacy was an international organization dedicated to fighting for animal rights with various funding, mainly from medical institutions
      and a few governments. Her funeral was quiet, fitting for the head of a spy agency. Multiple heads of ethics committees and such attended. In the same year, Fritz Simon retired and selected Link Gordon to fill his shoes. Under Jesper's guidance,
      EGGS became a well-oiled machine and shut down two TASTY parties: Marno McDermitt in 2003 and White Tower in 2004. Many agents were in awe of him and his stern appearance. Forty years old when he assumed the role of archdirector, he retired at the
      age of sixty in 2011.<br><br>Michaels became the new archdirector, who is also the current one. For his first two years in office, it was a difficult period of EGGS' history, as fast food became more popular than ever; so his happy, optimist nature
      was very much needed. He was an inspiring orator and more recruits than ever joined, competing with the booming catering industry. The Vice Director from 2011-2013 was Dart Foster, who went MIA on a very classified operation. He was replaced with
      Lily Warden, a field agent, who, like MacCartson graduated at the top of her class. <br><br>At the age of seven, while on a road trip, a drunk truck driver crashed into her family car, killing her father and brother. Warden was paralyzed from the
      waist down. When she and her mother recovered, her mother became very depressed and took to drinking, and one day committed suicide by jumping in front of a truck, claiming "I wanted to be reunited with my family." Warden was twelve years old. She
      was passed around the foster care system, but nobody wanted a "defective" child. Everybody assumed she couldn't do anything in the way of sports, and she was determined to prove them wrong. Finally she did, becoming the captain of the basketball
      team and named the most valuable player for her school baseball team. During university, for her thesis she did a paper on the effects of fast-food, discovering many of the same facts MacCartson did half a decade ago, leading her to join EGGS. </p>
