<h2 id="lore">HISTORIES</h2>
<div><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; It all started on April 15th, 1955 when Nikola MacCartson, a young reporter, went to review a new restaurant called&nbsp;McDonald. Digging deep beneath the surface, she uncovered horrifying tales of animals being experimented on and genetically modified in a quest to create the tastiest meat, mass bred, treated like&nbsp;unfeeling objects&nbsp;and other&nbsp;terrible facts. She discovered they were&nbsp;affiliated&nbsp;with KFC, then already a flourishing food chain, and Burger King, a new up-and-rising commerce. Their alliance was christened "TASTY". MacCartson prepared a powerful article, but the newspaper&nbsp;she worked for rejected it, saying it was "too disturbing for public eyes". Unable to just stand by and watch, she decided to do something, creating the birth of EGGS.</font></div>
<div><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></div>
<div><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing she could never combat such popular companies openly, she searched for like-minded people, first meeting up in in-the-wall restaurants, then in each other's houses and by 1960 when there were enough members, office rooms. They lived double lives, normal working class citizens by day, fast-food rebels by night. They would sneak into enemy offices and document incriminating paperwork, releasing it to the public in attempts to warn them. They protested, boycotted, put posters up,and handed out leaflets. The public listened for a while, however there were always people who went back to eat more.&nbsp;</font></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></span></div>
<div><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; By 1963, MacCartson realized that to defeat TASTY, they needed trained recruits. So she started up the Academy. Divided into five divisions (Administration, Communications, Field, Science and Life-savers), trainees studied the area they had the most aptitude for, at first undergoing two years of training and when new information was released and EGGS received more funding, the training period was extended to four years. Oregano Caning became Head of Administration, Jack Tripousa became Head of Communications,&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="background-color:rgb(0,0,0)"><span style="line-height: normal;">Jäger Dove became the Head of Field, Fritz&nbsp;Simon&nbsp;became&nbsp;the Head of Science and Douglas Doolie became Head of Life-savers.&nbsp;</span></span></font></div>

<div><span style="background-color:rgb(0,0,0)"><span style="line-height: normal;"><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Battle of Beruloo took place in 1965. EGGS had just discovered a massive experimentation site and agents were flocking into the final showdown. Tension was in the air and spirits were high. TASTY agents were in the lab and they were facing off.&nbsp;</span><br>
</font></span></span></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 1.25; background-color: transparent;"><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 1.25; background-color: transparent;"><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>1963 was also the year Agent Marian Mayhand graduated at the top of her class. A specialist, she became a legend, nicknamed the Infantry for her outstanding missions. Her field career was glowing and looking to become even brighter, until the tragedy of 1977.</font></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; Mayhand had been sent to take out a head of the TASTY animal experimentation called Arnold Z. Everything looked to be as expected until she arrived at the subject containment chambers, where the target was currently dissecting a live cow. Other cattle were being forced to watch this. Unknowingly, they had ruined the mission. Mayhand was behind her target, ready for a head shot, but the cattle saw her and mooed. He turned around and hit a red button, releasing a gas that made the bovines&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;angry and unlocking the cage doors. They all charged at her, but in accordance with EGGS beliefs she did not harm a single cow, instead interrogating Arnold Z. for the antidote, all the while dodging infuriated cows. She did not entirely succeed, and they were both very badly injured. Arnold Z. died before he gave the answer up, but the cattle calmed down after a few hours as the drug wore off. Mayhand sustained multiple injuries, putting her out of fieldwork forever.&nbsp;</font></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; Never one to give up, Mayhand went back to the Academy again as soon as she recovered to work in Communications, once more graduating at the top of her class. She quickly rose up the ranks, eventually directing the most complex operations, and working with some of the most influential people in EGGS' history, including Director Nikola MacCartson. In 1984, she was made Vice Director.&nbsp;</font></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The year was 1971 and Oregano Caning had decided to retire. The problem was, he hadn't selected his replacement yet and there were no obvious candidates. So, he thought up the Paperwork Competition of 1971. More paperwork than Administration could handle was coming in and they were at their wit's end. Agents were still filing mission reports from months ago, and they needed to deal with it fast. Candidates were to fill out as much paperwork as possible in a period of 24 hours, and the person to do it with the most quality would get the job. Ten candidates were shortlisted, and with much coffee and tea, Agent Shan Shou-Wen won.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="line-height: 1.25; background-color: transparent;">A few years later, in 1980,&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: normal; background-color: transparent;">Jäger Dove was fatally injured on a mission and died in a coma three days later. Quickly, Sanjay Adrian stepped in to take his place.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><span><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 16.6667px;"><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; When MacCartson retired in June 1990, t</span>he position of Director was taken over by Marian Mayhand, her Vice Director Blake Jesper. Jack Tripousa retired the same year, as did Shan Shou-Wen. They were replaced by Wilhelmina Watson and Gregory Hooter. Mayhand formed the Dorg Alliance and set up the departments of BELL, HEN, and CHICK. &nbsp;After analyzing the lastest fast food consumer statistics, she concluded that fast food chains were targeting children, as they were the new generation that grew up with fast food as something that had always been there and were too innocent to know the dangers of fast food. So she started to recruit children, in order to more efficiently battle TASTY. Sadly, her brilliant life was cut short as she was assassinated by a TASTY agent while delivering a speech. Her time as Director lasted just under a year.</font></span></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 16.6667px;"><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></div>
<div><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><span style="line-height: 16.6667px;"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Blake Jesper took over as archdirector with Robert "Bobby" Michaels as his vice. Neither a field agent or a reporter, Jesper was an amazing strategist and solved problems with an ease that unnerved many people.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="line-height: 16.6667px; background-color: transparent;">At the time of MacCartson's death in 1997, her&nbsp;legacy&nbsp;was an international organization dedicated to fighting for animal rights with various&nbsp;funding, mainly from medical institutions and a few governments. Her funeral was quiet, fitting for the head of a spy agency. Multiple heads of ethics committees and such attended. In the same year, Fritz Simon retired and selected Link Gordon to fill his shoes.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 16.6667px; background-color: transparent;">Under Jesper's guidance, EGGS became a well-oiled machine and shut down two TASTY parties: Marno McDermitt in 2003 and White Tower in 2004. Many agents were in awe of him and his stern appearance. Forty years old when he assumed the role of archdirector, he retired at the age of sixty in 2011.</span></font></div>
<div><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><span style="line-height: 16.6667px;"><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Michaels became the new archdirector, who is also the current one. For his first two years in office, it was a difficult period of EGGS' history, as fast food became more popular than ever; so his happy, optimist nature was very much needed. He was an inspiring orator and more recruits than ever joined, competing with the booming catering industry.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="line-height: 16.6667px; background-color: transparent;">The Vice Director from 2011-2013 was Dart Foster, who went MIA on a very classified operation. He was replaced with Lily Warden, a field agent, who, like MacCartson graduated at the top of her class.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 16.6667px; background-color: transparent;"><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2"><br>
</font></span></div>
<div><span style="background-color:transparent"><span style="line-height: 16.6667px;"><font face="courier new, monospace" size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; At the age of seven, while on a road trip, a drunk truck driver crashed into her family car, killing her father and brother. Warden was&nbsp;paralyzed&nbsp;from the waist down. When she and her mother recovered, her mother became very depressed and took to&nbsp;drinking, and one day committed suicide by jumping in front of a truck, claiming "I wanted to be reunited with my family." Warden was twelve years old. She was passed around the foster care system, but nobody wanted a "defective" child. Everybody assumed she couldn't do anything in the way of sports, and she was determined to prove them wrong. Finally she did, becoming the captain of the basketball team and named the most valuable player for her school baseball team. During university, for her thesis she did a paper on the effects of fast-food, discovering many of the same facts MacCartson did half a decade ago, leading her to join EGGS.&nbsp;</font></span></span></div>
